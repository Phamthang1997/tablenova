/**
 * Placeholder shown while a lazily-imported Monaco editor chunk is being fetched.
 *
 * Deliberately wordless: the wait is one chunk fetch off local disk (~200ms once, then the
 * module is cached and every later mount resolves synchronously), and a label would mean a
 * translation key for something almost nobody reads. It fills the panel so the surrounding
 * flex layout does not collapse and then snap back when the editor arrives.
 */
/**
 * The same job for a lazily-loaded **dialog** (`RowDocumentModal`).
 *
 * `LazyEditorFallback` carries `flex: 1` and a background of its own, which is right for a panel —
 * but a dialog renders through a portal and the fallback does not, so using that one would insert a
 * block into the middle of the grid's layout and then remove it when the chunk arrives. This one is
 * `position: fixed`, so it pushes nothing aside while still signalling that the click registered.
