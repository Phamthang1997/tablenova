// Stable identity for a connection, used as the localStorage scope for everything
// that must not leak between servers: open tabs + their auto-saved SQL, query
// history, saved queries.
//
// Why this exists: the old key was `${dbType}_${dbName}`, and `dbName` is just
// `config.database || config.sqlitePath` (see dbHelper.connect). Two servers
// hosting a database of the same name therefore shared one key — opening prod
// restored the draft SQL and tabs of localhost, and both wrote over each other.
// Redis was worse: `dbName` is `db${index}`, so every Redis server collapsed
// into `redis_db0`.
//
// Two levels of granularity, deliberately different:
//   connKey  -> the server (host:port, or the SQLite file). Query history uses
//               this, so switching database with USE keeps one timeline.
//   scopeKey -> server + database (+ Postgres schema). Tabs use this, because a
//               tab list belongs to a specific database (a table tab means
//               nothing after USE) and, on Postgres, to one schema of it.
// Credentials are not part of the identity: two profiles pointing at the same
// server with a full and a read-only account are the same server to the user.
