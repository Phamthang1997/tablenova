// profile, fetch the secrets from the OS store, merge them into the config, call `dbHelper.connect`.
// Rewriting that in the switcher would build a **second copy** of the connect path, and that path
// carries SSH, SSL, IAM and secret merging — two copies drift, and drift here shows up as "this
// profile connects on that screen but not on this one".
//
// Only "build a config from a profile" lives here. Building a config from the **form's state** is
// still Connection Manager's and needs no sharing: a saved profile *already has* a config, it merely
// lacks the secrets.
