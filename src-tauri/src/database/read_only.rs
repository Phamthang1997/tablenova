/// SQL editor sends arbitrary statement text, so guarding ~20 commands would leave the one path that
/// matters most guarded by whichever `if` someone remembered.
///
/// The funnels are **not** quite everywhere, though, and the four exceptions are exactly the ones
/// that hold their own connection: `commit_changes`, `run_fk_wrapped` (DROP/TRUNCATE),
/// `restore_backup` and `generate_data` go through `Exec`/an acquired pool connection because they
/// need one session for a batch — the same reason they must also ask `use_session()` rather than
/// `is_open()`. Each calls `reject_conn_read_only` at its entry. **A new path that takes its own
/// connection has to do the same**, and it fails loudly nowhere if it forgets: the write simply
/// succeeds on the connection labelled production.
///
/// `is_write_stmt` is deliberately conservative — `WITH` counts as a write, because a CTE can end in
/// INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE. Over-refusing costs a toggle; under-refusing costs the row.
