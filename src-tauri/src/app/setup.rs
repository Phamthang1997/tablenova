// Do NOT set_menu here. There used to be a hand-built "Edit" menu made of
// MenuItem::with_id, but it was useless and actively harmful:
//  - No on_menu_event existed -> clicking the items did nothing at all,
//    while they still claimed the Ctrl+Z/X/C/V/A accelerators.
//  - On Windows with decorations = false the native menu bar is drawn
//    inside the client area -> a faint "Edit" label on top of our own TitleBar.
//  - On macOS, Tauri already attaches a full Menu::default() (App/File/Edit/
//    View/Window/Help) whose copy/paste items really work when the builder
//    does not call .menu() — see tauri/src/app.rs. set_menu() in setup()
//    runs later, so it was OVERWRITING that good menu with a broken one.
// Dropped entirely: macOS gets its default menu back, and on Windows/Linux
// WebView2/WebKitGTK handle clipboard inside inputs on their own anyway.
