//! The MCP surface: the six tools an AI client can call, and nothing else.
//!
//! This file holds the DECLARATIONS - names, parameter schemas, descriptions - because
//! `#[tool_router]` wants them in one impl block. The bodies live in `catalog.rs` (introspection)
//! and `data.rs` (rows).
//!
//! Every tool is a read. There is no write tool in this build, and adding one is not a matter of
//! writing another method: defence layer 5 (interactive approval) does not exist yet, and a write
//! that reaches the database without it commits on a pooled connection the user cannot roll back.
//! See `docs/mcp-server-plan.md` §3.5.
//!
//! Parameter structs derive `JsonSchema`, so the schema an AI reads is generated from the very
//! struct the body destructures - the two cannot drift.
