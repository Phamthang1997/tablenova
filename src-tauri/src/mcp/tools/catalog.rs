//! The four introspection tools: what connections exist, and what is inside one.
//!
//! These reuse the very bodies the TableNova UI calls, through the `*_inner` entry points that take
//! an `&AppState` instead of a `tauri::State`. That is the point - schema introspection is a pile of
//! dialect-specific SQL, and a second copy written for AI clients would answer a different question
//! from the sidebar within a release or two.
//!
//! Reusing them is only safe because `policy::resolve` has already refused a connection in manual
//! commit mode: these bodies go through the ROUTED funnel, which would otherwise open the user's
//! transaction for them. See `policy::reject_if_manual`.

// Every body below runs under `target.timeout`, i.e. `policy::mcp_timeout()` - the same ceiling
// `data.rs` applies. These three used to call `policy::resolve()` and throw the `Target` away, so
// introspection was the one MCP path with no time limit at all. That was accepted at V1 on the
// grounds that a catalog query is bounded by its nature rather than by the data, which is true right
// up until a server with thousands of tables makes it false - and an AI client has no Stop button
// either way. Closing it costs one wrapper per body, so the argument for leaving it open was thin.

/// Every connection the user shared, and nothing else - the filtering happens in the registry so no
